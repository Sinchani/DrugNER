Cannabis products have been administered for many centuries; today, cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug all over the world. Nevertheless, the interpretation of cannabis findings in blood with regard to consumption behaviour and/or estimating the elapsed time since the last cannabis use is still a very challenging task. A wide variation of pharmacokinetic parameters has been observed even in experimental studies. Different chemical structures of precursors, smoking dynamics, pyrolysis of phytocannabinoids and frequency of drug use affect the amount of THC absorbed. Polymorphic enzymes are involved in phase-I-metabolism of THC. Pharmacological effects of other cannabinoids or medication on the pharmacokinetics of THC have not yet been studied in detail. Hydrolysis of cannabis conjugates may occur during storage of blood samples and processing of specimens for analysis; knowledge on the stability of cannabinoids in forensic specimens is still poor. Whether determination of cannabinoid conjugates may be useful is a matter of further consideration. At present, the broad variation of pharmacokinetic parameters and the limiting factors discussed in the present paper should be taken into account when using data from experimental studies for interpretation of analytical results in forensic case work.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d212</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Improvement of colchicine oral bioavailability by incorporating eugenol in the nanoemulsion as an oil excipient and enhancer.&#xd;
The effect of eugenol on colchicine transport across an isolated rat intestinal membrane was studied using an in vitro diffusion chamber system. We found that eugenol increased the absorptive transport of the drug efficiently. The effect of eugenol on intestinal absorption of colchicine in an oral administrative nanoemulsion formulation was also demonstrated in vivo. The colchicine nanoemulsion was prepared with isopropyl myristate, eugenol, Tween80, ethanol and water, and eugenol was used as an oil phase in the formulation; an average particle size of this nanoemulsion was 41.2    7.2 nm. The permeation of colchicine in the nanoemulsion across the intestinal membrane was significantly different from that of the control group (0.2 mM colchicine). Finally, co-administration of eugenol in colchicine nanoemulsion to enhance the colchicine bioavailability was investigated by an oral administration method. After oral administration of colchicine (8 mg/kg) in the form of either the nanoemulsion or in free colchicine solution, the relative bioavailability of nanoemulsion and eugenol-nanoemulsion were enhanced by about 1.6- and 2.1-fold, respectively, compared with free colchicine solution. The procedure indicated that the intestinal absorption of colchicine was enhanced significantly by eugenol in the tested nanoemulsion. All the results suggested that eugenol is an efficient component in an oral administrative formulation for improving the intestinal absorption of colchicine.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s0.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="15" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s0.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="64" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s1.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="141" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s1.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="152" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s2.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="286" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s3.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="368" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s3.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="404" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s4.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="501" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s4.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="564" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s4.e4"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="582" length="7"/><text>ethanol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s4.e5"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="605" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s6.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="742" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s6.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="871" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s7.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="914" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s7.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="925" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s7.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="964" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s8.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1071" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s8.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1142" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s8.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1212" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s8.e3"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1308" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s9.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1387" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s9.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1428" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s10.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1495" length="7"/><text>eugenol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d212.s10.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1610" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d149</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Protective effects of ginseng-ginko extracts combination on rat primary cultured neurons induced by Abeta(1-40)].&#xd;
To observe the injury in rat primary cultured neurons induced by Abeta(1-40) and the protective effects of combination of ginseng and ginko extracts.Primary neurons were induced by Abeta(1-40) to establish the cell model of toxic injury. Using flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, MTP assay, transmission electron microscopy and Western blot, the appropriate concentration and duration of AP for cell model establishment were determined. The effects of extracts of ginseng and ginko (EGGB) on cellular proliferative activity, apoptotic rate, ultrastructure and caspase-3 expression were detected. The apoptotic rate was increased significantly after neurons were induced by 1 micromol x L(-1) Abeta(-40) for 24 h (P &lt; 0.01). EGGB (5, 50 mg L(-1)) significantly enhanced the proliferative activity (P &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, EGGB (50 mg L(-1)) inhibited neuronal apoptosis and caspase-3 overexpression and improved cellular ultrastructure remarkably (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). Abeta(1-40) could significantly induce primary cultured neurons to apoptosis in vitro. EGGB showed beneficial neuroprotective effects against neuronal apoptosis, which might be due to improving the structures of neuron and its subcellular organelles, enhancing cellular proliferative activity and inhibiting caspase-3 overexpression in neurons.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s0.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="23" length="7"/><text>ginseng</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s0.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="31" length="5"/><text>ginko</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s1.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="238" length="7"/><text>ginseng</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s1.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="250" length="5"/><text>ginko</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s4.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="599" length="7"/><text>ginseng</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s4.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="611" length="5"/><text>ginko</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s4.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="618" length="4"/><text>EGGB</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s6.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="859" length="4"/><text>EGGB</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s7.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="954" length="4"/><text>EGGB</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s8.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1101" length="11"/><text>Abeta(1-40)</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d149.s9.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1188" length="4"/><text>EGGB</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d207</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.&#xd;
An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d207.s1.e4"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="364" length="11"/><text>isopropanol</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d155</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The role of interneurons in shaping Purkinje cell responses in the cerebellar cortex.&#xd;
The well established anatomy of the cerebellar cortex has led to suggestions that cerebellar molecular layer interneurons laterally inhibit Purkinje cells. In support of the anatomical predictions, on-beam excitation and off-beam inhibition of Purkinje cells have been shown to occur when the surface of the cerebellum is electrically excited. Patchy excitation of Purkinje cells with flanking inhibition of sagittally oriented Purkinje cells have also been demonstrated following peripheral stimulation in vivo. To extend these observations, we mapped the functional connectivity between granule cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells in rats. Patches of granule cells were asynchronously activated by photostimulation to mimic their excitation by a mossy fiber as it occurs in vivo. We found with remarkable consistency that, in the sagittal orientation, granule cells elicit a stereotypic set of responses. Granule cells immediately underneath a Purkinje cell provide pure excitation. Granule cells positioned 340-400   m laterally provided pure inhibition, consistent with the lateral inhibition proposed earlier. The net effect of exciting granule cells in between these two extremes was to provide a systematic change in the response of Purkinje cells, from net excitation to net inhibition moving laterally from the Purkinje cell. In contrast to the sagittal orientation, in the coronal orientation the organization of Purkinje cell responses with granule cell activation was remarkably different. Independent of the location of granule cells, within the 480   m lateral distance examined, molecular layer interneurons reduced the strength of granule cell inputs to Purkinje cells to a comparable extent.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d172</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Clarity and applicability of drug-drug interaction management guidelines: a systematic appraisal by general practitioners and community pharmacists in the Netherlands.&#xd;
Despite the availability and daily use of computerized drug-drug interaction surveillance systems, exposure to potentially relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) continues. DDI management guidelines are often inadequate and clear management options are lacking, which attributes to overriding of DDI signals. Although general criteria for the development and reporting of high-quality clinical practice guidelines have been identified, it appears these have not yet been applied to DDI management guidelines.The aim of the study was to assess the clarity and applicability of guidelines for the management of potentially harmful DDIs. We selected 13 DDIs that are potentially harmful for patients and frequently occur in community pharmacy practice in the Netherlands. The clarity and applicability of the management guidelines of these DDIs were appraised using the appropriate two domains - 'Clarity and presentation' and 'Applicability', of the validated Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Instrument. The appraisal was performed by 12 community pharmacists and 12 general practitioners. The standardized domain scores and mean item scores for 'Clarity and presentation' and 'Applicability' were compared. All DDI management guidelines were generally found to score well on 'Clarity and presentation', but poorly with respect to 'Applicability' (standardized domain scores 68.0 vs 26.1%). Within the domain 'Clarity and presentation', the item 'tools for application' received the lowest scores. Within the domain 'Applicability', cost implications, organizational barriers and key review criteria were all poorly documented. All guidelines presented non-directive advice using words such as 'consider' and 'regularly'. Developers of DDI management guidelines should take the appropriate domains of the AGREE Instrument into consideration in their development processes. The applicability of DDI management guidelines should be pretested before publishing. To improve guideline quality, more attention should particularly be paid to the available tools for applications and cost implications.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d210</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Drug interactions on P-glycoprotein transport level and its application].
Potential drug interactions on P-glycoprotein transport level were discussed in this article. As an efflux transporter protein widely distributed in various tissues, P-glycoprotein plays an important role in many drugs interactions, via affecting the metabolic process to alter the concentration of drug in plasma and tissue. Interactions between herb and western drug may occur by inducing or inhibiting P-glycoprotein, resulting in either efficacy enhancement or adverse effects. So it is important for clinical drug use by rational utilization of the interaction between herb and western drug which medicated by P-glycoprotein.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d148</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>A circadian clock in hippocampus is regulated by interaction between oligophrenin-1 and Rev-erb  .&#xd;
Oligophrenin-1 regulates dendritic spine morphology in the brain. Mutations in the oligophrenin-1 gene (OPHN1) cause intellectual disability. We discovered a previously unknown partner of oligophrenin-1, Rev-erb  , a nuclear receptor that represses the transcription of circadian oscillators. We found that oligophrenin-1 interacts with Rev-erb   in the mouse brain, causing it to locate to dendrites, reducing its repressor activity and protecting it from degradation. Our results indicate the presence of a circadian oscillator in the hippocampus, involving the clock gene Bmal1 (also known as Arntl), that is modulated by Rev-erb   and requires oligophrenin-1 for normal oscillation. We also found that synaptic activity induced Rev-erb   localization to dendrites and spines, a process that is mediated by AMPA receptor activation and requires oligophrenin-1. Our data reveal new interactions between synaptic activity and circadian oscillators, and delineate a new means of communication between nucleus and synapse that may provide insight into normal plasticity and the etiology of intellectual disability.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d156</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>ABC transporters influence sensitivity of Brugia malayi to moxidectin and have potential roles in drug resistance.&#xd;
Some ABC transporters play a significant role in human health and illness because they confer multidrug resistance (MDR) through their overexpression. Compounds that inhibit the drug efflux mechanism can improve efficacy or reverse resistance. Of the eight described ABC transporter subfamilies, those proteins conferring MDR in humans are in subfamilies A, B, C, and G. In nematodes, transporters in subfamilies B and C are suggested to confer resistance to ivermectin. The Brugia malayi ABC transporter superfamily was examined to assess their potential to influence sensitivity to moxidectin. There was an increase in expression of ABC transporters in subfamilies A, B, C, and G following treatment. Co-administration of moxidectin with inhibitors of ABC transporter function did not enhance sensitivity to moxidectin in males; however, sensitivity was significantly enhanced in females and microfilariae. The work suggests that ABC transporters influence sensitivity to moxidectin and have a potential role in drug resistance.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d156.s4.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="575" length="10"/><text>ivermectin</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d196</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Single-dose bioequivalence of 105-mg fenofibric acid tablets versus 145-mg fenofibrate tablets under fasting and fed conditions: a report of two phase I, open-label, single-dose, randomized, crossover clinical trials.&#xd;
Fenofibrate is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed lipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia in adults who do not respond to nonpharmacologic measures. Fenofibrate is a prodrug that is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to fenofibric acid, the active moiety. A new orally administered agent, fenofibric acid, was developed as an alternative to fenofibrate.Two separate studies were conducted to evaluate the bioequivalence of fenofibric acid relative to fenofibrate under fasted and fed (standard breakfast) conditions, characterize the pharmacokinetic profile, and assess the safety and tolerability of fenofibric acid. In study 1 (fasted), during each study period, volunteers received a single 105-mg dose of fenofibric acid or single 145-mg dose of fenofibrate (depending on their randomization scheme) after an overnight fast (a minimum fast of 10 hours). A 7-day washout period followed the first treatment period, after which the volunteers received the alternate treatment. Study 2 followed a similar dosing scheme and differed only in that volunteers received their single dose after being fed a standard meal (575 calories, of which 36% were contributed by fat). Serial blood samples in both studies were collected up to 72 hours after drug administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest for assessing bioequivalence were AUC(0-t), AUC(0-   ), C(max), and T(max). The criterion for a lack of difference between products was a 90% CI between 0.80 and 1.25 for the fenofibric acid:fenofibrate ratios for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-   ), and C(max.) Tolerability was assessed by adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters, vital signs, and physical examinations. Volunteers in study 1 (fasted; n = 54) were aged 18 to 43 years; 19 (35%) were men and 35 (65%) were women; mean weight was 155.2 pounds (range, 103.0-267.0 pounds); and 48 (89%) were white, 1 (2%) was black, and 5 (9%) were white/American Indian/Alaskan native/Asian. Volunteers in study 2 (fed; n = 54) were aged 18 to 43 years; 27 (50%) were men and 27 (50%) were women; mean weight was 161.9 pounds (range, 112.0-225.0 pounds); and 51 (94%) were white (including 2 Hispanic) and 3 (6%) were black. The 90% CIs about the ratio of the fenofibric acid geometric mean to the fenofibrate geometric mean were within the 80% and 125% limits for the pharmacokinetic parameters C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-   ) of the ln-transformed data in both study 1 (fasted) and study 2. In study 1 (fasted), 14 volunteers (26%) experienced a total of 29 AEs; the most common nonlaboratory AEs were dizziness (6%) and headache (4%). In study 2, 12 volunteers (22%) experienced a total of 19 AEs; the most common nonlaboratory AEs were headache (17%) and dry throat (4%). AEs were generally mild or moderate in intensity. In these 2 single-dose studies, these healthy volunteers administered a single oral dose of 105-mg fenofibric acid met the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory criteria for assuming bioequivalence to a single oral dose of 145-mg fenofibrate tablets with respect to the rate and extent of fenofibric acid absorption in both fed and fasted states. Fenofibric acid at the dose studied was well tolerated in this population.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s0.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="37" length="15"/><text>fenofibric acid</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s0.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="75" length="11"/><text>fenofibrate</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s1.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="219" length="11"/><text>Fenofibrate</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s2.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="379" length="11"/><text>Fenofibrate</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s3.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="518" length="15"/><text>fenofibric acid</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s3.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="570" length="11"/><text>fenofibrate</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s4.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="652" length="15"/><text>fenofibric acid</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s4.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="680" length="11"/><text>fenofibrate</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s4.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="830" length="15"/><text>fenofibric acid</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s5.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="938" length="15"/><text>fenofibric acid</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s5.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="979" length="11"/><text>fenofibrate</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s10.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1711" length="15"/><text>fenofibric acid</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s10.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1727" length="11"/><text>fenofibrate</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s20.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="2435" length="15"/><text>fenofibric acid</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s20.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="2473" length="11"/><text>fenofibrate</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s26.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="3101" length="15"/><text>fenofibric acid</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s26.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="3237" length="11"/><text>fenofibrate</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s26.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="3296" length="15"/><text>fenofibric acid</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d196.s27.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="3354" length="15"/><text>Fenofibric acid</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d157</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Tradition and toxicity: evidential cultures in the kava safety debate.&#xd;
This paper examines the debate about the safety of kava (Piper methysticum Forst. f, Piperaceae), a plant native to Oceania, where it has a long history of traditional use. Kava became popular as an anti-anxiety treatment in Western countries in the late 1990s, but it was subsequently banned in many places due to adverse reports of liver toxicity. This paper focuses on the responses to the bans by scientists involved in kava research, contrasting their evidential culture with that employed by clinicians and regulatory officials. Cultural constructions and social negotiations of risk are shown to be context-specific, and are shaped by professional, disciplinary, and organizational factors, among others. Though the science of hepatotoxicity is uncertain enough to allow for multiple interpretations of the same data, the biomedical/clinical narrative about kava remains dominant. This case study explores the influence of these cultural, social, and political factors on the production of scientific knowledge and the assessment of benefit/risk posed by comestibles.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d225</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Pharmacological drugs inducing ototoxicity, vestibular symptoms and tinnitus: a reasoned and updated guide.&#xd;
The present work on drug-induced ototoxicity, tinnitus and vertigo represents the update and revision of a previous guide to adverse drug reactions for italian physicians (2005). The panorama of drug-induced side effects causing ototoxicity or symptoms such as tinnitus or dizziness and vertigo has enlarged in recent years, thanks to a better knowledge and a more specific attention of pharmaceutical firms and drug-control institutions. In daily clinical practice, there is a need for the family physician and the ENT specialist or audiologist (also in consideration of the possible medico-legal implications) to focus the attention on the possible risk of otological side effects. This would allow a clinical risk-benefit evaluation, weighing the possible clinical advantage in their field of competence against possible otological side-effects. The list of active ingredients and drugs is subdivided in categories based on their audiological and otoneurological side-effects, that have been signaled by the drug companies and/or ministerial notes. Drugs have also been subcategorized with regards to the field in which they are applied, the therapeutic indications and the clinical behaviour. They have also been organized in alphabetical order, for an easier consultation. The guide above, even if initially conceived for being used in Italy, also presents a more general and international interest, expecially as for as the concepts of pharmacology and the features of the active ingredients are concerned. The guide is, therefore, useful as for as we are concerned to any physician, regardless of the country he/she operates in.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d167</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Opportunities and challenges in the development of experimental drug combinations for cancer.&#xd;
It is becoming increasingly evident that cancers are dependent on a number of altered molecular pathways and can develop diverse mechanisms of resistance to therapy with single agents. Therefore, combination regimens may provide the best hope for effective therapies with durable effects. Despite preclinical data to support this notion, there are many challenges to the development of targeted combinations including scientific, economic, legal, and regulatory barriers. A discussion of these challenges and identification of models and best practices are presented with intent of aiding the research community in addressing real and perceived barriers to the development of combination therapies for cancer.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d171</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Infections with human immunodeficiency viruses. Part II: Antiretroviral drugs, therapeutic options, and diagnostics].Infections with the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1) lead to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), resulting in the establishment of a wide range of severe opportunistic infections. Since the introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into the treatment of HIV infections, in many cases a delayed appearance of AIDS-defining diseases is achievable. Life expectancy of antiretrovirally treated HIV-infected people applying HAART could be considerably extended and now resembles that of several other chronic diseases. For the initial treatment of HIV-1 infection, an adjunction with three antiretroviral agents is generally used. In most cases, the application of two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) together with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase inhibitor (II) is recommended. Before and during antiretroviral treatment, antiretroviral drug resistances, individual tolerance profiles and the needs of the individual patient, as well as several interactions with other drugs have to be considered. Diagnostics of HIV infection is based upon the proof of specific antibodies.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d170</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Positive shifts of the GABAA receptor reversal potential due to altered chloride homeostasis is widespread after status epilepticus.&#xd;
  -Aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission plays an important role in the initiation of epileptic activity and the generation of ictal discharges.The functional alterations in the epileptiform hippocampus critically depend on GABAergic mechanisms and cation-chloride cotransporters.To understand the cellular basis of specific functional alterations in the epileptic hippocampus, we studied physiologic characteristics and pharmacologically isolated evoked GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded from principal neurons in hippocampal slices from status epilepticus (SE) and control rats using whole-cell and gramicidin perforated patch-clamp recordings. Whereas the resting membrane potential and input resistance were not significantly different between control and epileptic tissue, the reversal potential (E(GABA) ) of IPSCs was significantly shifted to more positive values in SE rats with regard to the resting membrane potential. Pharmacologic experiments and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the observed changes in the epileptic tissue were due to a decreased ratio of the main Cl(-) extrusion transporter (K(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter, KCC2) to the main Cl(-) uptake transporter (Na(+) -K(+) -2Cl(-) cotransporter, NKCC1). Our results suggest that alterations of cation-chloride cotransporter functions, comprising a higher NKCC1 action, contribute to hyperexcitability within the hippocampus following SE.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d142</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Effects of glycyrrhiza extract on pharmacokinetics property of daphnetin in rats].&#xd;
To research the influence of glycyrrhiza extract on the pharmacokinetics characteristic parameters of daphnetin, which was aimed to explore the rationality of concert application of drugs.The rats received intragastric administration of daphnetin and glycyrrhiza extract containing the same daphnetin respectively. The blood concentration of daphnetin was assayed by LC-MS. The data was processed by program DAS2.1.1. Glycyrrhiza extract can reduce the t(1/2), tmax and Ke of daphnetin, while increased the Ka and AUC(0-infinity). Glycyrrhiza extract promoted the oral absorption of daphnetin, slowed down the elimination and increased the biological availability.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d168</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Spontaneous spiking and synaptic depression underlie noradrenergic control of feed-forward inhibition.&#xd;
Inhibitory interneurons across diverse brain regions commonly exhibit spontaneous spiking activity, even in the absence of external stimuli. It is not well understood how stimulus-evoked inhibition can be distinguished from background inhibition arising from spontaneous firing. We found that noradrenaline simultaneously reduced spontaneous inhibitory inputs and enhanced evoked inhibitory currents recorded from principal neurons of the mouse dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Together, these effects produced a large increase in signal-to-noise ratio for stimulus-evoked inhibition. Surprisingly, the opposing effects on background and evoked currents could both be attributed to noradrenergic silencing of spontaneous spiking in glycinergic interneurons. During spontaneous firing, glycine release was decreased due to strong short-term depression. Elimination of background spiking relieved inhibitory synapses from depression and thereby enhanced stimulus-evoked inhibition. Our findings illustrate a simple yet powerful neuromodulatory mechanism to shift the balance between background and stimulus-evoked signals.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d152</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Mechanisms of drug toxicity or intolerance.&#xd;
Classically, adverse drug reactions had been considered as type A reactions which are related to the main pharmacological action of the drug and therefore are predictable. Such reactions are predictable, reversible, and usually can be managed by lowering the dose of the offending drug. However, other adverse effects of drugs can occur which are unrelated to the main pharmacological action of the drug - type B reactions. Such adverse effects are termed idiosyncratic and are often initiated by metabolites of the parent drug or by other indirect mechanisms. The detailed understanding of adverse drug events has become a major focus of the regulatory agencies throughout the world. The pharmacotherapy of gastrointestinal and liver disorders is becoming increasingly complex. In recent years, with the advent of novel therapeutic agents to treat a host of disorders, including viral hepatitis, gastrointestinal motility disorders, inflammatory bowel disease and others, the potential for serious clinically relevant drug reactions has increased. In the pharmacotherapy of gastrointestinal and liver diseases, a significant number of adverse events that occur can be explained by drug interactions. Some pharmacokinetic drug interactions are based on the competitive inhibition of the rate of drug metabolism of one of the drugs, leading to an increased concentration of the drug which was not intended. In other examples, the interaction can be mechanistic in which one or more drugs when co-administered potentiate each other's actions without any change in drug levels, termed pharmacodynamic interactions.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d220</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Evaluation of hepatic clearance and drug-drug interactions of luteolin and apigenin by using primary cultured rat hepatocytes.&#xd;
The hepatic clearance and drug-drug interactions of luteolin and apigenin were studied by using primary cultured rat hepatocytes. Luteolin and apigenin experienced extensive first-pass metabolism. The elimination percent of luteolin and apigenin was found to be 91.9% and 86.7% after 120 min of incubation. The predicted % liver blood flow was 82.3% and 85.4% for luteolin and apigenin, respectively. Total glucuronidated/sulfated conjugates of luteolin/apigenin were determined by an enzyme hydrolysis method. Compared with the elimination of pure luteolin and apigenin, the elimination of luteolin and apigenin was much lower in hydrolyzed Flos Chrysanthemi extract (FCE) containing comparable amounts of luteolin and apigenin. The effect of a series of flavonoids, including flavonols, flavones, isoflavone, flavanone, flavanonols and catechins, on the elimination of luteolin and apigenin was studied. At least four key determinants in the chemical structures of flavonoids are necessary for exerting the inhibitory effects on the conjugation: 1) catechol structure (3',4'-dihydroxylation) in the B-ring; 2) B-ring is attached to the C-2 position on the C-ring; 3) the C2-3 double bond in conjunction with the C4 carbonyl group on the C-ring; 4) no glycoside present. Investigation of clearance and interaction among flavonoids could help us better understand their bioavailability and offer insight into the approaches to be taken to minimize competitive effects, and to design appropriate bioavailability studies in humans.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d221</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>An autopsy case of multiple psychotropic drug poisoning.&#xd;

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that appears essentially as a sporadic condition. PD is well known to be a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease produced by a selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The main clinical features of PD include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. Most insights into pathogenesis of PD come from investigations performed in experimental models of PD, especially those produced by neurotoxins. The biochemical and cellular alterations that occur after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment are remarkably similar to that observed in idiopathic PD. Furthermore, it is well known that acute treatment with MPTP can cause a severe loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter protein levels and dopamine contents in the striatum of mice, as compared to continuous MPTP treatment. Thus these findings may support the validity of acute MPTP treatment model for unraveling in the neurodegenerative processes in PD. In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective effects of various compounds against neuronal cell loss in an MPTP model of PD. This review may lead to a much better understanding of PD as well as provide novel clues to new targets for therapeutic interventions in PD patients.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d203</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Potential underuse, overuse, and inappropriate use of antidepressants in older veteran nursing home residents.&#xd;
To examine prevalence and resident- and site-level factors associated with potential underuse, overuse, and inappropriate use of antidepressants in older Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Center (CLC) residents.Longitudinal study. One hundred thirty-three VA CLCs. Three thousand six hundred ninety-two veterans aged 65 and older admitted between January 1, 2004, and June 3, 2005, with long stays (    90 days). Prevalence of potential underuse, inappropriate use, and overuse of antidepressants in residents with and without depression (as documented according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes or Depression Rating Scale). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most commonly prescribed antidepressant. Of the 877 residents with depression, 25.4% did not receive an antidepressant, suggesting potential underuse. Of residents with depression who received antidepressants, 57.5% had potential inappropriate use due primarily to problems seen with drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Of the 2,815 residents who did not have depression, 1,190 (42.3%) were prescribed one or more antidepressants; only 48 (4.0%) of these had a Food and Drug Administration-approved labeled indication, suggesting potential overuse. Overall, only 17.6% of antidepressant use was appropriate (324/1,844). The only consistent resident factor associated with potential underuse and overuse use was taking an antipsychotic without evidence of schizophrenia (underuse: adjusted relative risk ratio (ARRR)=0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.33-0.94; overuse: adjusted odds ratio=1.52, 95% CI=1.21-1.91). Having moderate to severe pain (ARRR=1.54, 95% CI=1.08-2.20) and the prescribing of an anxiolytic or hypnotic (ARRR=1.33, 95% CI=1.02-1.74) increased the risk of potential inappropriate antidepressant use. Potential problems with the use of antidepressants were frequently observed in older U.S. veteran CLC residents. Future studies are needed to examine the true risks and benefits of antidepressant use in CLC and non-VA nursing homes.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d144</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Older adults with multi-morbidity: medication management processes and design implications for personal health applications.&#xd;

The aim of this study is to investigate the synergistic effect of chondroitinase ABC and growth factors in the integration of murine retinal progenitor cells (mRPCs) transplanted into Rho(-/-) mice.mRPCs from P1 green fluorescent protein-transgenic mice were isolated and expanded for transplantation. All mRPCs of 20 passages or less were transplanted into the subretinal space of B6 mice together with chondroitinase ABC, and into Rho(-/-) mice combined with chondroitinase ABC, N-[N-(3, 5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1. Cell counts were used to examine the migration and survival rate of mRPCs in B6 mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the differentiation and integration of mRPCs in B6 and Rho(-/-) mice. Our results show that substantial numbers of mRPCs migrated and survived in the retina when transplanted with chondroitinase ABC into B6 and Rho(-/-) mice. Chondroitinase ABC disrupted the glial scar around the mRPCs in the subretinal space. Only a few mRPCs expressed recoverin in B6 mice. More mRPCs expressed rhodopsin, recoverin, and synaptophysin after transplantation into Rho(-/-) mice when combined with chondroitinase ABC and growth factors. The synergistic effect of chondroitinase ABC and growth factors facilitates the anatomic integration of mRPCs transplanted into Rho(-/-) mice.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d146</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Post-exposure prophylaxis for H1N1 with oseltamivir in renal allograft recipient--safe and effective without any immunosuppresive drug interaction.&#xd;

Curcumin is the active ingredient of commonly used spice Curuma longa Linn. In the present study, the antidepressant like activity of curcumin and its combination with fluoxetine and imipramine was studied in acute model (three doses 24, 5 and 1 h before test) of forced swimming test (FST) in glass jar and tail suspension test (TST) in mice and in chronic model (14 day study) of FST with water wheel in rats. All the tests were carried out in the following seven groups (n = 6 in each group), drugs being given orally (doses for mice): Group 1 (vehicle), group 2 (curcumin 50 mg/kg), group 3 (curcumin 100 mg/kg), group 4 (fluoxetine 20 mg/kg), group 5 (imipramine 15 mg/kg), group 6 (curcumin 100 mg/kg plus fluoxetine 20 mg/kg) and group 7 (curcumin 100 mg/kg plus imipramine 15 mg/kg). Equivalent doses for rats were used. Both the acute model of FST and TST, and the chronic model of FST with water wheel showed significant antidepressant like activity of curcumin in 100 mg/kg dose as compared to vehicle control (p &lt; 0.05). The effect of curcumin (100 mg/kg) was similar to that of fluoxetine and imipramine (p > 0.05) but its addition to fluoxetine and imipramine did not improve their antidepressant activity (p > 0.05). Curcumin increased both the swimming and climbing behavior in FST, thus its antidepressant like activity could be due to an increase in serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the brain. Curcumin can be a useful antidepressant especially in cases which respond to drugs having mixed effects on serotonin and catecholamines levels in the brain.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s0.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="80" length="10"/><text>fluoxetine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s0.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="95" length="10"/><text>imipramine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s2.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="304" length="10"/><text>fluoxetine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s2.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="319" length="10"/><text>imipramine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s3.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="762" length="10"/><text>fluoxetine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s3.e3"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="793" length="10"/><text>imipramine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s3.e5"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="848" length="10"/><text>fluoxetine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s3.e7"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="906" length="10"/><text>imipramine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s6.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1227" length="10"/><text>fluoxetine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s6.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1242" length="10"/><text>imipramine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s6.e3"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1284" length="10"/><text>fluoxetine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d206.s6.e4"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1299" length="10"/><text>imipramine</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d229</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Novel insights into the synergistic interaction of Bortezomib and TRAIL: tBid provides the link.&#xd;

Standard antibiotic such as Gentamicin (10 microg), Cephalothin (30 microg), Ceftriaxone (10 microg), Nystatin (10 U) discs were used for comparison with the antimicrobial activities of essential oils of these plants. In addition, antibacterial activity of essential oils of these plants was researched by effects when it was used together with these standard antibiotics in vitro. However, antibacterial activity changed also by in vitro interactions between these standard antibiotics and essential oils of these plants. Synergic, additive or antagonist effects were observed in antibacterial activity.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d215.s12.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1474" length="10"/><text>Gentamicin</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d215.s12.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1498" length="11"/><text>Cephalothin</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d215.s12.e3"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1523" length="11"/><text>Ceftriaxone</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d215.s12.e4"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1548" length="8"/><text>Nystatin</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d177</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Polypharmacy and drug interactions].&#xd;
The growing consumption of drugs and other numerous factors relates to the increasing incidence of polypharmacy. The proportion of patients currently treated with 5 or more medicines at the elderly population in particular is 30-60% of patients. Repeatedly has been proven the dependence between the number of concomitant drugs and occurrence of adverse effects, patients requiring hospitalization, or incidence of moderate and serious drug interactions. Some works show that it is possible to satisfactorily address the issues of polypharmacy, but it requires great courage and an interdisciplinary approach involving modern information technology.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d226</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Does implementation of benchmarking in quality circles improve the quality of care of patients with asthma and reduce drug interaction ].The purpose of this cluster-randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of quality circles (QCs) working either with general data-based feedback or with an open benchmark within the field of asthma care and drug-drug interactions.Twelve QCs, involving 96 general practitioners from 85 practices, were randomised. Six QCs worked with traditional anonymous feedback and six with an open benchmark. Two QC meetings supported with feedback reports were held covering the topics "drug-drug interactions"and "asthma";in both cases discussions were guided by a trained moderator. Outcome measures included health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction with treatment, asthma severity and number of potentially inappropriate drug combinations as well as the general practitioners' satisfaction in relation to the performance of the QC. A significant improvement in the treatment of asthma was observed in both trial arms. However, there was only a slight improvement regarding inappropriate drug combinations. There were no relevant differences between the group with open benchmark (B-QC) and traditional quality circles (T-QC). The physicians' satisfaction with the QC performance was significantly higher in the T-QCs. General practitioners seem to take a critical perspective about open benchmarking in quality circles. Caution should be used when implementing benchmarking in a quality circle as it did not improve healthcare when compared to the traditional procedure with anonymised comparisons.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d174</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and antiplatelet effect of acetylsalicylic acid. selective approach to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in cardiological practice].&#xd;
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent class of medicines which is wide concerning chemical structure and mechanism of action. In the light of contradictory data on efficacy and safety of NSAID in cardiovascular patients selection of most appropriate NSAID (basing on profile of efficacy and safety) in patients receiving continuous therapy with low dose aspirin appears to be a problem.

Despite its long history of use and abuse in human culture, the molecular basis for alcohol action in the brain is poorly understood. The recent determination of the atomic-scale structure of GLIC, a prokaryotic member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) family, provides a unique opportunity to characterize the structural basis for modulation of these channels, many of which are alcohol targets in brain. We observed that GLIC recapitulates bimodal modulation by n-alcohols, similar to some eukaryotic pLGICs: methanol and ethanol weakly potentiated proton-activated currents in GLIC, whereas n-alcohols larger than ethanol inhibited them. Mapping of residues important to alcohol modulation of ionotropic receptors for glycine,   -aminobutyric acid, and acetylcholine onto GLIC revealed their proximity to transmembrane cavities that may accommodate one or more alcohol molecules. Site-directed mutations in the pore-lining M2 helix allowed the identification of four residues that influence alcohol potentiation, with the direction of their effects reflecting   -helical structure. At one of the potentiation-enhancing residues, decreased side chain volume converted GLIC into a highly ethanol-sensitive channel, comparable to its eukaryotic relatives. Covalent labeling of M2 positions with an alcohol analog, a methanethiosulfonate reagent, further implicated residues at the extracellular end of the helix in alcohol binding. Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated the structural consequences of a potentiation-enhancing mutation and suggested a structural mechanism for alcohol potentiation via interaction with a transmembrane cavity previously termed the "linking tunnel."These results provide a unique structural model for independent potentiating and inhibitory interactions of n-alcohols with a pLGIC family member.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s0.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="21" length="7"/><text>alcohol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s1.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="167" length="7"/><text>alcohol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s2.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="480" length="7"/><text>alcohol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s3.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="624" length="7"/><text>ethanol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s4.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="774" length="7"/><text>alcohol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s4.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="964" length="7"/><text>alcohol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s5.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1094" length="7"/><text>alcohol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s6.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1289" length="7"/><text>ethanol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s7.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1398" length="7"/><text>alcohol</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d198.s8.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1680" length="7"/><text>alcohol</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d145</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>IGF1R-targeted therapy and its enhancement of doxorubicin chemosensitivity in human osteosarcoma cell lines.&#xd;

Prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke is an important part of atrial fibrillation management. However, stroke risk is not homogeneous and varies with associated morbidities and risk factors. Risk stratification schemes have been developed that categorize patients' stroke risk into classes based on a combination of risk factors. According to the calculated level of risk, guidelines recommend patients with atrial fibrillation receive antithrombotic therapy either as a vitamin K antagonist or aspirin. Despite recommendations, however, many patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive adequate thromboprophylaxis. We will discuss some of the underlying reasons, in part related to the drawbacks associated with vitamin K antagonists. These highlight the need for new anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation. The novel oral anticoagulants in development may overcome some of the limitations of vitamin K antagonists and address their underuse and safety concerns.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d188</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>It makes scents.&#xd;

Since rejection or infection occurs at irregular drug concentrations immunosuppressive drug therapy is often empiric and prophylactic in nature. In addition, blood immunosuppressant levels are only indirect predictors of the pharmacologic effects on immune cells, because the genetic heterogeneity the immune systems of transplant recipients are not equally sensitive to drug effects. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring requires the application of reliable and effective methods to study the pharmacodynamic variability by direct measurements of drug effects on immune cell functions. Flow cytometry offers a multiplicity of quantitative analysis possibilities, from detection of phosphorylated molecules up to complex multicolor analysis of whole blood samples. A large spectrum of flow cytometry-based applications for pharmacodynamic monitoring is available and allows detection and analysis of diverse function of T cells and dendritic cell subsets. By combining several assays, it is possible to generate a broad picture of the immune status of every single transplanted recipient. Furthermore, it is even possible to differentiate between synergistic and antagonistic pharmacodynamic effects of immunosuppressive drug combination therapy in vitro and to predict the pharmacodynamic drug effects in transplanted recipients. Such a pharmacodynamic drug monitoring may offer the opportunity to complete conventional therapeutic drug monitoring and, therefore, to tailor immunosuppressive therapy more individually.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d176</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Nitric oxide is an activity-dependent regulator of target neuron intrinsic excitability.&#xd;
Activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength are well established as mediating long-term plasticity underlying learning and memory, but modulation of  target neuron excitability could complement changes in synaptic strength and regulate network activity. It is thought that homeostatic mechanisms match intrinsic excitability to the incoming synaptic drive, but evidence for involvement of voltage-gated conductances is sparse. Here, we show that glutamatergic synaptic activity modulates target neuron excitability and switches the basis of action potential repolarization from Kv3 to Kv2 potassium channel dominance, thereby adjusting neuronal signaling between low and high activity states, respectively. This nitric oxide-mediated signaling dramatically increases Kv2 currents in both the auditory brain stem and hippocampus (&amp;gt;3-fold) transforming synaptic integration and information transmission but with only modest changes in action potential waveform. We conclude that nitric oxide is a homeostatic regulator, tuning neuronal excitability to the recent history of excitatory synaptic inputs over intervals of minutes to hours.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d176.s0.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="0" length="12"/><text>Nitric oxide</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d224</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>The influence of chemical activation on tooth bleaching using 10% carbamide peroxide.&#xd;
The aim of this study was to assess the influence of manganese gluconate, a chemical activator of bleaching agents, at a concentration of 0.01% on the efficiency of a 10% carbamide peroxide-based bleaching agent. Forty bovine incisors were immersed in a 25% instant coffee solution for seven days and randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 was the control group and consisted of 10% carbamide peroxide-based bleaching gel only. Group 2 consisted of 10% carbamide peroxide-based bleaching gel and 0.01% manganese gluconate. Three readings of color were taken using the Vita Easyshade spectrophotometer: the initial reading, a reading at seven days, and a reading at 14 days. Total color variation was calculated by   E*Lab. Data were submitted to the statistical t-test (5%), which showed that after seven days group 2 had a significant increase in the degree of tooth bleaching compared with group 1. The mean values (  SD) were 16.33 (  3.95) for group 1 and 19.29 (  4.97) for group 2. However, the results for group 1 and group 2 were similar after 14 days. Adding 0.01% manganese gluconate to 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching gel increased the degree of tooth bleaching after a seven-day treatment and did not influence the resulting shade after 14 days.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d162</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Placebo effect in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.&#xd;

Globally, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV interact in deadly synergy. The high burden of TB among HIV-infected individuals underlies the importance of TB diagnosis, treatment and prevention for clinicians involved in HIV care. Despite expanding access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat HIV infection in resource-limited settings, many individuals in need of therapy initiate ART too late and have already developed clinically significant TB by the time they present for care. Many co-infected individuals are in need of concurrent ART and anti-TB therapy, which dramatically improves survival, but also raises several management challenges, including drug interactions, shared drug toxicities and TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Due to the survival benefits of promptly initiating ART among all HIV-infected individuals, including those with TB, it is recommended that co-infected individuals receive treatment for both diseases, regardless of CD4+ cell count. We review current screening and treatment strategies for TB and HIV co-infection. Recent findings and ongoing studies will assist clinicians in managing the prevention and treatment of TB and HIV co-infection, which remains a major global health challenge.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d150</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Network neighbors of drug targets contribute to drug side-effect similarity.&#xd;
In pharmacology, it is essential to identify the molecular mechanisms of drug action in order to understand adverse side effects. These adverse side effects have been used to infer whether two drugs share a target protein. However, side-effect similarity of drugs could also be caused by their target proteins being close in a molecular network, which as such could cause similar downstream effects. In this study, we investigated the proportion of side-effect similarities that is due to targets that are close in the network compared to shared drug targets. We found that only a minor fraction of side-effect similarities (5.8 %) are caused by drugs targeting proteins close in the network, compared to side-effect similarities caused by overlapping drug targets (64%). Moreover, these targets that cause similar side effects are more often in a linear part of the network, having two or less interactions, than drug targets in general. Based on the examples, we gained novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of side effects associated with several drug targets. Looking forward, such analyses will be extremely useful in the process of drug development to better understand adverse side effects.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d197</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Vitamin D and drugs].;Interactions between drugs and vitamin D have received only little or no attention in the medical and pharmaceutical world in the past.

This study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial effects of an o-cymen-5-ol/zinc system.o-Cymen-5-ol and zinc gluconate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined against Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Candida albicans. Synergy was investigated by checkerboard MIC/MBC; inhibition of P. gingivalis protease activity and S. mutans glycolysis were investigated. Slurried toothpastes containing the system were assessed in kill time assays against S. mutans and E. coli. o-Cymen-5-ol MIC was between 1.7 mM to 3.4 mM; MBC was 3.4 mM to 6.7 mM. Zinc gluconate MIC was 2.8 mM to 11 mM; MBC was between 11 mM and >44 mM. The two agents in solution showed synergy (FICI   0.50) against P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, with MIC of 0.42 mM/0.69 mM for o-cymen-5-ol/zinc gluconate, respectively. Zinc inhibited glycolysis and protease to a greater degree than o-cymen-5-ol; glycolysis inhibition by the two agents was additive. o-Cymen-5-ol/zinc chloride in toothpaste showed greater effects than placebo (120s log10 kill=7.35  0.40 and 4.02  0.40, respectively). The zinc/o-cymen-5-ol system has direct antimicrobial effects and inhibits oral disease-related processes. Synergistic effects were seen against anaerobes.

Blood samples were collected from the orbital venous plexus at indicated time points and were analyzed for amiodarone concentration using RP-HPLC. The geometric mean ratio for C(max) and AUC(0-96) was calculated. There were no significant differences between the pharmacokinetics parameters of amiodarone administered intravenously or intragastrically and the control (without neferine) group (with ratios of 0.7-1.4 in all experimental groups), suggesting that neferine had no effect on amiodarone plasma pharmacokinetics.

Colchicine is commonly used for the treatment of gout and occasionally for other inflammatory diseases. It has a narrow therapeutic index and the potential for severe or fatal toxicity.We sought to determine (1) the frequency of colchicine toxicity among hospitalized patients taking colchicine who died during an admission, (2) the likelihood that colchicine contributed to death, (3) whether patients were taking interacting medications that could have contributed to toxicity, and (4) whether colchicine dosing among these patients adhered to established guidelines. We conducted an IRB-approved, retrospective chart review at an urban, tertiary care, 1228-bed, university hospital. Subjects included hospitalized patients who received colchicine and died in hospital between 1 January 2000 and 28 February 2007. We reviewed charts for signs and symptoms of colchicine toxicity. An expert panel reviewed each case and classified the likelihood of colchicine toxicity, the likelihood of a causal role of colchicine in the death using the WHO classification system, and the appropriateness of colchicine dosing. Thirty-seven hospitalized patients who died during the 86-month study period received colchicine. Toxicity was unlikely in 20/37, possible in 8/37, likely in 5/37, and certain in 4/37. A contributing role for colchicine in causing death was unlikely in 24/37, possible in 7/37, likely in 3/37, and certain in 3/37. Colchicine doses (based on creatinine clearance) exceeded the accepted range for 12 patients, including 10 of 17 cases of toxicity and 8 of 13 cases of death classified as possible or higher. Seventeen patients received interacting medications, including 8 of 17 cases of toxicity and 8 of 13 cases of death classified as possible or higher. Colchicine toxicity was frequent in this cohort and may have contributed to about one-third of the deaths. Inappropriate dosing of colchicine occurred frequently and was related to toxicity and death.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s0.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="35" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s1.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="73" length="10"/><text>Colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s3.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="302" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s3.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="357" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s3.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="422" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s3.e3"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="569" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s5.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="812" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s6.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="934" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s7.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1023" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s7.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1079" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s7.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1167" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s8.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1272" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s10.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1395" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s11.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1501" length="10"/><text>Colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s13.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1843" length="10"/><text>Colchicine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d175.s14.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1974" length="10"/><text>colchicine</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d192</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a dopamine receptor-mediated opiate reward memory switch in the basolateral amygdala-nucleus accumbens circuit.The basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) play central roles in the processing of opiate-related associative reward learning and memory. The BLA receives innervation from dopaminergic fibers originating in the VTA, and both dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors are expressed in this region. Using a combination of in vivo single-unit extracellular recording in the NAc combined with behavioral pharmacology studies, we have identified a double dissociation in the functional roles of DA D1 versus D2 receptor transmission in the BLA, which depends on opiate exposure state; thus, in previously opiate-naive rats, blockade of intra-BLA D1, but not D2, receptor transmission blocked the acquisition of associative opiate reward memory, measured in an unbiased conditioned place preference procedure. In direct contrast, in rats made opiate dependent and conditioned in a state of withdrawal, intra-BLA D2, but not D1, receptor blockade blocked opiate reward encoding. This functional switch was dependent on cAMP signaling as comodulation of intra-BLA cAMP levels reversed or replicated the functional effects of intra-BLA D1 or D2 transmission during opiate reward processing. Single-unit in vivo extracellular recordings performed in neurons of the NAc confirmed an opiate-state-dependent role for BLA D1/D2 transmission in NAc neuronal response patterns to morphine. Our results characterize and identify a novel opiate addiction switching mechanism directly in the BLA that can control the processing of opiate reward information as a direct function of opiate exposure state via D1 or D2 receptor signaling substrates.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d192.s7.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="1532" length="8"/><text>morphine</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d186</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Motor deficits and recovery in rats with unilateral spinal cord hemisection mimic the Brown-Sequard syndrome.&#xd;
Cervical incomplete spinal cord injuries often lead to severe and persistent impairments of sensorimotor functions and are clinically the most frequent type of spinal cord injury. Understanding the motor impairments and the possible functional recovery of upper and lower extremities is of great importance. Animal models investigating motor dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury are rare. We analysed the differential spontaneous recovery of fore- and hindlimb locomotion by detailed kinematic analysis in adult rats with unilateral C4/C5 hemisection, a lesion that leads to the Brown-S  quard syndrome in humans. The results showed disproportionately better performance of hindlimb compared with forelimb locomotion; hindlimb locomotion showed substantial recovery, whereas the ipsilesional forelimb remained in a very poor functional state. Such a differential motor recovery pattern is also known to occur in monkeys and in humans after similar spinal cord lesions. On the lesioned side, cortico-, rubro-, vestibulo- and reticulospinal tracts and the important modulatory serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic fibre systems were interrupted by the lesion. In an attempt to facilitate locomotion, different monoaminergic agonists were injected intrathecally. Injections of specific serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists in the chronic phase after the spinal cord lesion revealed remarkable, although mostly functionally negative, modulations of particular parameters of hindlimb locomotion. In contrast, forelimb locomotion was mostly unresponsive to these agonists. These results, therefore, show fundamental differences between fore- and hindlimb spinal motor circuitries and their functional dependence on remaining descending inputs and exogenous spinal excitation. Understanding these differences may help to develop future therapeutic strategies to improve upper and lower limb function in patients with incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries.</text></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d222</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>Treatment of nicotine dependence with Chantix (varenicline).&#xd;
Varenicline is the generic name for Chantix, the newest drug available for the treatment of tobacco dependence. In a randomized controlled clinical trial, the abstinence rate at 1 year for patients using varencline was superior to that of patients in the group using bupropion SR (Zyban) and in the placebo group (11). Varenicline reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms, cigarette craving and nicotine satisfaction. Post-market reports prompted a warning of serious adverse neuropsychiatric events in patients taking varenicline. As is the case with any surgical procedure and/or prescription medication, full disclosure of the risks and benefits should be discussed with the patient. The significant health benefits of quitting smoking should be weighed against the individual's risk of adverse events associated with the use of varenicline for smoking cessation.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s0.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="13" length="8"/><text>nicotine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s0.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="47" length="11"/><text>varenicline</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s1.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="62" length="11"/><text>Varenicline</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s2.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="266" length="10"/><text>varencline</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s2.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="329" length="12"/><text>bupropion SR</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s3.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="381" length="11"/><text>Varenicline</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s3.e1"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="401" length="8"/><text>nicotine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s3.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="453" length="8"/><text>nicotine</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s4.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="577" length="11"/><text>varenicline</text></annotation><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d222.s6.e0"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="890" length="11"/><text>varenicline</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d151</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Seniors and cardiovascular medications].&#xd;
Authors analyze the situation in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases--unsatisfactory situation especially from the dyslipidaemia point of view. Different groups of medications are discussed and their risks for elderly patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme blockers and their influence on the endothelial dysfunction, but the risk of hyperpotassemia are showed. The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding during the treatment with antiagregants and anticoagulants, the risk of bradycardia in beta-blockade, possible interactions with other medications lowering the heart rate are discussed. Attention is paid to calcium channel blockers, diuretics and digoxin. The table containing possible clinical symptoms of unwanted side effect of most frequently used cardiovascular medications in elderly is added as the conclusion of the article.</text><annotation id="DDI-MedLine.d151.s5.e2"><infon key="type">drug</infon><location offset="694" length="7"/><text>digoxin</text></annotation></passage></document><document><id>DDI-MedLine.d178</id><passage><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>0</offset><text>[Ticagrelor: a novel antiplatelet agent for patients with acute coronary syndrome].&#xd;
